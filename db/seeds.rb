# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
Home.create(name: 'second name', description: 'this is second name')
Home.create(name: 'thirsd', description: 'this is third name')
Home.create(name: 'forth' ,description: 'this is forth name')

# ary = ["second name","third name"]
#  ary.each do |sample|
#  	Home.create(name: sample)
#  end
